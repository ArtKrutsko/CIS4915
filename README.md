Predicting Academic Performance of USF Students
Welcome to our project repository!

This repository hosts the development and implementation of predictive models aimed at forecasting the academic performance of incoming University of South Florida (USF) students based on their high school achievements and other related factors.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to utilize machine learning (ML) techniques to assist USF in identifying students who might need additional academic support early on, enabling targeted interventions to improve student success and retention rates.

Our models take into account various high school performance metrics and demographic information to provide actionable insights for university advisors and stakeholders.
